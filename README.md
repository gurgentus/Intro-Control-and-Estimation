# intro-control-and-estimation
Lecture notes for the class I taught on Control Theory and Estimation at Ohio University

This tutorial contains a set of notes I created for a special topics course in control theory and state estimation for applied math majors. Control theory is a perfect ‘capstone’ course for advance undergraduates as it combines rigorous mathematics of optimization, differential equations, dynamical systems, linear algebra, calculus of variations, probability, and other more theoretical areas of mathematics with practical use of computer programming, numerical methods and engineering applications.
As such, the goal is twofold, first to introduce the more theory oriented students to the beautiful world of engineering applications in control theory, a perfect example of the use of the higher level mathematics in the `real world’, and second, to give a sound theoretical footing to those students that are more applied and engineering oriented.

Warning: These notes are a work in progress and I expect to have the full notes done by the end of Summer 2017.
