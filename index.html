This tutorial contains a set of notes I created for a special topics course in control theory and state estimation for applied math majors.
Control theory is a perfect ‘capstone’ course for advance undergraduates as it combines rigorous mathematics of optimization, differential
equations, dynamical systems, linear algebra, calculus of variations, probability, and other more theoretical areas of mathematics with
practical use of computer programming, numerical methods and engineering applications.
As such, the goal is twofold, first to introduce the more theory oriented students to the beautiful world of engineering applications in 
control theory, a perfect example of the use of the higher level mathematics in the `real world’, and second, to give a sound theoretical
footing to those students that are more applied and engineering oriented.
